## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a site where many flash games can be played after flash player is unsupported in browsers. This site uses [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) to emulate flash player and run flash in the website. This allows anyone to play flash games even without flash player installed.
## Focus
The current main focus is to finish designing the site and expand the game library.
